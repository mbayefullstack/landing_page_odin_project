# Landing Page Project

This project is part of the **Foundations Course** of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The objective is to create a responsive landing page based on a provided design, showcasing fundamental HTML and CSS skills.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to translate a static design into a functional and styled web page, apply concepts such as Flexbox for layout, fonts, and color styling, and practice building structured HTML and CSS code.

## Design Reference

The project is based on the following design images: (1) **Full Design** - A complete view of the web page, and (2) **Details Design** - Specifications for colors and fonts used in the project. The designs provide a general guideline. Exact replication (pixel-perfect implementation) is not required, but the final project should closely resemble the provided layouts.

## Features

- **Static Web Page**: A functional and visually structured landing page.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Desktop-focused layout (mobile styling will be learned later).  
- **Hero Section**: Includes a prominent header text and an image.  
- **Four Main Sections**: Each section highlights different elements of the design.  
- **Footer**: Contains useful links and basic footer content.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring content.  
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout using Flexbox.  
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and hosting.

Development Notes
Approach
Start with the HTML structure: Define semantic sections (header, main, footer, etc.) and add all content placeholders before styling.
Apply CSS styling: Use the provided font and color details and implement layout using Flexbox for sections.
Test and refine: Compare with the design for consistency and focus on maintaining clean, readable code.
